### Sign your work

We use the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) as an additional safeguard for the CSPR.design project. This is a well established and widely used mechanism to assure contributors have confirmed their right to license their contribution under the project's license.

Please read [developer-certificate-of-origin](https://github.com/make-software/cspr-design/blob/main/.github/developer-certificate-of-origin).

If you can certify it, then just add a line to every git commit message:

```
Signed-off-by: Random J Developer <random@developer.example.org>
```

Use your real name (sorry, no pseudonyms or anonymous contributions).

If you set your `user.name` and `user.email` git configs, you can sign your commit automatically with `git commit -s`. You can also use git [aliases](https://git-scm.com/book/tr/v2/Git-Basics-Git-Aliases) like `git config --global alias.ci 'commit -s'`. Now you can commit with `git ci` and the commit will be signed.
